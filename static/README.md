# static
static - is a keyword that defines properties or methods that belong to a class itself rather than the object created from that class  
class owns anything static and not the the object 

## I practiced static keyword using the examples below:
### Example 1:
```javascript
class MathUtilities{
    static PI = 3.14159

    static getDiamater(radius){
        return radius * 2;
    }
    static getCircumference(radius){
        return (this.PI * radius * 2).toFixed(2);
    }
    static getArea(radius){
        return (this.PI * radius * radius).toFixed(2);
    }
}
console.log(MathUtilities.PI);
console.log(MathUtilities.getDiamater(15));
console.log(MathUtilities.getCircumference(7));
console.log(MathUtilities.getArea(18));
```

#### output:
```javascript
console.log(MathUtilities.PI);              // 3.14159
console.log(MathUtilities.getDiamater(15)); // 30
console.log(MathUtilities.getCircumference(7)); // 43.98
console.log(MathUtilities.getArea(18));         // 1017.88
```

### Explanation of the code:
- I created a class called *MathUtilities* to hold math-related utilities like PI, diameter, circumference, and area.
- I used the *static* keyword so that I could call all properties and methods **directly on the class**, without creating any object instance.
- I declared a static property *PI* and gave it the value 3.14159 so that I could reuse it in all circle calculations.
- I added a static method *getDiameter(radius)* so that the code can return the diameter of a circle by simply multiplying the radius by 2.
- I added a static method *getCircumference(radius)* so that the code can return the circumference using the formula *this.PI * radius * 2*, and I used *this.PI* to refer to the static *PI* within the class.
- I added a static method *getArea(radius)* to return the area of a circle using the formula *this.PI * radius * radius*, formatted to 2 decimal places using .*toFixed(2)*.
- I logged all the methods to the console so I could confirm the calculations worked without needing to instantiate the class.

### Example 2:
```javascript
class User{
    static userCount = 0;

    constructor(username){
        this.username = username;
        User.userCount ++;
    }

    static getUserCount(){
        console.log(`There are ${User.userCount} users online`);
    }

    sayHello(){
        console.log(`My username is ${this.username}`);
    }
}

const user1 = new User("Linus");
const user2 = new User("Annette");
const user3 = new User("Laura");

user1.sayHello();
user2.sayHello();
user3.sayHello();

console.log(user1.username);
console.log(user2.username);
console.log(user3.username);

User.getUserCount();
console.log(User.userCount);
```

#### output:
```javascript
user1.sayHello(); // My username is Linus
user2.sayHello(); // My username is Annette
user3.sayHello(); // My username is Laura

console.log(user1.username); // Linus
console.log(user2.username); // Annette
console.log(user3.username); // Laura

User.getUserCount(); // There are 3 users online
console.log(User.userCount); // 3
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- I created a class called User to model users, each with a unique *username*.
- I used a *static* property *userCount = 0* so that the class can keep track of how many users have been created.
- I added a *constructor(username)* method so that each time I create a new user, it stores their username in *this.username*, and then increments the global *userCount* by 1.
- I created a static method *getUserCount()* so that the code can print out how many users exist without needing an instance.
- I created an instance method *sayHello()* so each user object can introduce itself using its own *username*.
- I instantiated three users *(user1, user2, and user3)* using the *new* keyword so that each user object has its own data.
- I called *sayHello()* on each user so that they could introduce themselves using their unique username.
- I accessed *User.userCount *and called *User.getUserCount()* so that I could confirm the static counter worked as expected.

## What I learnt from the examples demonstrated above
1. How to declare static properties and methods so they live on the class, not on each object.
2. How this inside a static context refers to the class, while inside an instance method it refers to the current object.
3. How to blend static and instance logic in one classâ€”for example, tracking how many objects have been created.
4. When to choose utility-only classes (all static) versus regular classes with per-object state.
