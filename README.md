This repository documents my learning journey in JavaScript — from fundamentals to advanced topics. It’s organized to reflect my growth as a self-taught developer, with each upload containing well-structured code, detailed README notes, and practical exercises.

**This repository has:**

- Organized folders covering key topics: variables, functions, DOM manipulation, events, async JS, etc.

- A detailed README with every upload explaining the concept and code

- Integrated HTML and CSS files for projects and mini-apps

- A challenges/ folder containing multiple real-world coding challenges and solutions

- Regular updates as I progress through the JavaScript ecosystem
